# Nextcloud Turtia Dark Theme

Modified version of [Breeze Dark Theme for Nextcloud](https://github.com/mwalbeck/nextcloud-breeze-dark) for my own Nextcloud

The original Breeze Dark Theme for Nextcloud is based on the Breeze Dark theme made by the KDE Project

The icons are from the default Nextcloud theme and the individual apps, with the colors changed to better fit the theme
