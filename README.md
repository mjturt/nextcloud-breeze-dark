# Nextcloud Turtia Dark Theme

Modified version of [Breeze Dark Theme for Nextcloud](https://github.com/mwalbeck/nextcloud-breeze-dark)

The original Breeze Dark Theme for Nextcloud is based on the Breeze Dark theme made by the KDE Project

Changes have been made to make the theme fit better for my own Nextcloud. I recommend using the original [Breeze Dark Theme for Nextcloud](https://github.com/mwalbeck/nextcloud-breeze-dark)
